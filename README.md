# Bootcamp-Module1-Challenge

## Description
This is my Web Development Bootcamp's Module 1 Challenge: Refactoring the existing code
This challege majorly focuses on the accessibility of the website.

In order to achieve the accessibility of the website, I have done with following points,
1. Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
2. HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
3. Image and icon elements contain accessible 'alt' attributes
4. Heading attributes fall in sequential order
5. Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

## Usage
The refactoring of the existing code involves a very important aspect of the Web Development i.e. Accessibility. Web accessibility is making websites beneficial and accessible for people with disabilities.
